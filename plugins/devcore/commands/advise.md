**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

I'm looking for best practices, most idiomatic, most standard way of doing this. I want expert feedback—not for you to just mindlessly agree with me, because this is a situation where I genuinely lack expertise.

In order to do this, you may wish to spawn one or more devcore:senior-advisor agents (use different perspectives for each), which may be able to provide more unbiased inputs with their fresh context. 

If the scope is smaller, please just consider my problem as a teacher and senior advisor, not as a programming assistant. In this situation, I want you to reason about the "best" solution, rather than just parrotting what I say.
