description: Create a new slash command
argument-hint: <command-name>
---

Create a new slash command file with proper structure. Gather requirements from the user, and follow best prompting practices. Save the command to project or user (ask me, unless easy to infer).

The command should:
- Include descriptive frontmatter with description and argument-hint
- Use clear argument placeholders if needed ($1, $2, etc.)
- Be concise and actionable
